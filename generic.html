					<h2>My Academic Career</h2>
					<p>
						I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Technology from the School of Engineering (SOE) at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT). While my formal academic journey provides me with a solid foundation in computer science, my passion for technology goes beyond textbooks and lectures.
					</p>
				
					<ul class="achievements">
						<li>
							<h3>School Project: Python & MySQL Integration</h3>
							<p>
								As part of my academic coursework, I embarked on a project to create a movie ticket booking software. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply my programming skills in Python and explore database management with MySQL. It provided a practical perspective on the software development process.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Hardware Enthusiast</h3>
							<p>
								Beyond the classroom, I have nurtured a deep interest in hardware projects. I have undertaken a variety of projects, One of my most notable achievements is the creation of a miniature working model of a Tesla car. This project was a labor of love and earned me the first prize in a science exhibition. It reflects my dedication to innovation, attention to detail, and the ability to bring technological ideas to life.
